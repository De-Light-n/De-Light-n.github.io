      content: " Marketing doesn't work in a straight line. It means that campaigns shift, deadlines move, and what seemed like a great idea last month might be irrelevant today. That's why you've got to get your project management methods right. If you don't, it'll slow you down, burn through budgets, and leave teams drowning in unnecessary admin. Enter Agile marketing – a faster, more adaptable way to get things done.

At colloc, we don't do blocked, fully mastering plans that take six months to roll out. An effective marketing plan should be achievable, adaptable, and built to drive real results. We believe in best-moving data-led execution – which is exactly what Agile brings to the table.",
